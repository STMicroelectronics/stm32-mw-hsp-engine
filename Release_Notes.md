# Release Notes for
# <mark>HSP Engine SW Pack</mark>


# Purpose

STM32Cube enables developers to achieve design success. With a comprehensive suite of professional development tools and embedded software components, STM32Cube allows developers to differentiate products, streamline design cycles, and reduce costs. STM32Cube ecosystem supports all design steps, including selection, configuration, development, debugging, programming, and monitoring.
The STM32Cube embedded software offer provides ready-to-use software components that can be added to a project. It includes STM32 peripheral driver APIs with two levels of abstraction, middleware, board drivers, and examples. There are several distribution channels, including the STM32CubeMX2 tool, the ST website, and GitHub. All embedded software comes with enhanced online documentation, with flowcharts and user sequences.

The HSP Engine Middleware is an efficient interface to configure and process complex signal processing through the STM32 HSP peripheral.
The middleware provides high-level APIs (Direct Command, DSP, and CNN) to perform mathematical operations such as those found in standard ARM DSP or CMSIS-NN.
It contains also services to build and configure complex processing chains using the Sequencer Mode, through a processing list manager.
